I am a Ph.D. student at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu) studying theoretical physics in the group of [Erich Mueller](https://muellergroup.lassp.cornell.edu).

My research lies at the intersection of AMO (atomic, molecular and optical) and condensed matter physics. Broadly, I am interested in the ways that ultracold atomic systems can be used as a playground to realize exotic physics seen in other ("real") systems as well as completely new systems that have never been studied before. I have worked on a variety of problems during my Ph.D., ranging from the [transport of fermions on a lattice](/publication/2021-10-25-FermiHubbardWeakCoupling) to [unconventional superconductors](/publication/2022-07-27-Sr2RuO4Domains) to the nature of [superfluids in one dimension](/publication/2022-04-04-BoseHubbardSuperfluidity). I am also interested in the properties of tensor networks for simulating quantum mechanical systems, which has overlap with a number of my projects.

On this site you'll find descriptions of some of the problems I've focused on as well as links to my published and unpublished work.
