## Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu). I received my Ph.D in theoretical physics from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu), where I studied under [Erich Mueller](https://www.lassp.cornell.edu/erich-mueller-group). Prior to that I got my undergraduate degree in Physics and Italian from [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu/) (2014-2018), where I rowed on the lightweight crew team. Outside of physics, I enjoy cooking, traveling, hiking, rock climbing and playing tennis.

## Research Description

My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical AMO (atomic, molecular and optical) and condensed matter physics. Specifically, I like to think about the ways that [ultracold atom experiments](/research) can contribute to unresolved questions in condensed matter physics. I've studied a range of problems during my Ph.D., broadly focusing on the equilibrium and dynamical properties of strongly-interacting and low-dimensional systems. I employ a combination of analytic and numerical techniques in my work, most notably tensor network methods. Take a look at the [research](/research) section for a description of my research interests, or just check out my [publications](/publications).

<!-- My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical AMO (atomic, molecular and optical) and condensed matter physics. I have studied a variety of problems related to current ultracold atom experiments during my Ph.D., with a particular focus on the transport problems, frustration and low-dimensional systems. Over the course of this work, I developed an expertise in working with matrix product states for ground-state optimization, thermal ensembles and time-evolution. I am interested in some of the more technical questions of how to make these simulations more efficient.

 [transport problems](/publication/2021-10-25-FermiHubbardWeakCoupling) and [low-dimensional systems](/publication/2022-04-04-BoseHubbardSuperfluidity). In these works I cultivated an expertise in working with matrix product states (MPSs), specifically with ground-state optimization and time-evolution in the thermodynamic limit. I am also interested in some of the more [technical questions](/publication/2022-12-14-MPSQuantumNumbers) of how to make these simulations more efficient. Additionally, I have collaborated on problems with a more tranditional condensed matter valence, including [ultrasound attenuation in unconventional superconductors](/publication/2022-07-27-Sr2RuO4Domains) and [metal-insulator transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13355) in moirÃ© transition metal dicalchogenides.
