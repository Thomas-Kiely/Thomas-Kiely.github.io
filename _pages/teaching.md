Over the course of my undergraduate and graduate education, I've had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant (TA) for a wide range of courses. This has exposed me to the nuts and bolts of physics education at all levels of experience and in a variety of settings (e.g. labs, discussion sections, lectures, flipped classrooms, remote/hybrid classrooms). I have found that I really enjoy teaching, particularly the challenge of taking a concept and breaking it down into digestible pieces. This process has taught me a lot, even when teaching material that I've been comfortable with for over a decade. Below you'll find a list of my teaching experiences as well as my student evaluations, when available.

## 2023
- TA for **PHYS-2214: Physics III: Oscillations, Waves, and Quantum Physics** (Cornell, Spring 2023)
    - Course Instructor: Glenn Case
    - Lead two discussion sections and a lab section, created weekly quizzes, graded homework, proctored and graded exams.

## 2022
- Grader for **PHYS-7653: Statistical Physics II** (Cornell, Fall 2022)
    - Course Instructor: Chao-Ming Jian
    - Graded problem sets and wrote solutions
