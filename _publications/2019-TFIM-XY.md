excerpt: 'Trapped ionic systems allow for long-lived realizations of one-dimensional Hamiltonians, which can serve both to answer basic science questions and to realize novel quantum mechanical devices, namely quantum computers. There are, however, certain limitations that experimentalists must contend with. One such limitation is in the nature of allowed interactions between the trapped ions, which can dramatically reduce the accessible range of applications. In this paper, we studied how the XY model (very difficult to engineer) emerges from the transverse-field Ising model (much easier to engineer) in the limit of a large transverse field. This trick has been used by the Monroe group to simulate the XY model stroboscopically. After demonstrating the general behavior of this approximation, we computed a variety of experimentally-relevant observables. Interestingly, we found that the strobosocopic approximation to the Greens function is particularly sensitive to experimental imperfections.'
