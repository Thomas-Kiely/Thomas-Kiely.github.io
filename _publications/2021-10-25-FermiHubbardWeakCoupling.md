excerpt: 'Strongly correlated materials, where electron-electron interactions dominate, display a range of important yet poorly understood phenomena including high temperature superconductivity and exotic magnetism. Many such materials also feature unusual "strange metal"  transport, corresponding to unexpected temperature dependence of the resistivity. In this paper, we showed that weakly-interacting systems can display resistivity signatures typically associated with such strange metals. The origin of this effect is bandstructure nesting (at low temperatures) and a bounded spectrum (at high temperatures). These results are particularly important for interpreting recent cold atom experiments exploring transport in Fermi-Hubbard systems, as these experiments are constrained to operate at very high effective temperatures.'
