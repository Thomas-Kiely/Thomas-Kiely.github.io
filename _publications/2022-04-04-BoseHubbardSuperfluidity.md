title: "Superfluidity in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model"

permalink: /publication/2022-04-04-BoseHubbardSuperfluidity
excerpt: 'Superfluidity is a phenomenological property of systems with bosonic excitations that can loosely be understood as having zero viscosity. In three dimensions, systems that exhibit superfluidity often also exhibit phase coherence across macroscopic length scales, which is known as Bose-Einstein condensation. If the system is one-dimensional, however, strong quantum fluctuations destabilize such phase coherence -- this is known as the Mermin-Wagner effect. Nonetheless, as we argue in this paper, superfluid phenomenology can persist. We study a paradigmatic strongly-interacting bosonic system, the 1D Bose-Hubbard model, using infinite tensor network techniques. We map out the superfluid density across the zero-temperature phase diagram and relate it to the Luttinger parameters.'
