title: "Strong Increase in Ultrasound Attenuation Below Tc in Sr2RuO4: Possible Evidence for Domains"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-07-27-Sr2RuO4Domains
excerpt: 'Sr2RuO4 is a material with a number of unconventional properties. In particular, the nature of its superconducting gap is disputed. This paper reports on a study of ultrasound attenuation in Sr2RuO4 across the superconducting transition. The experiments, performed by Sayak Ghosh in the lab of Brad Ramshaw, found that the ultrasound attenuation constant increases as one decreases the temperature below Tc. My contribution to this work was to model this result, which disagrees with conventional s-wave BCS theory, using a variety of other gap functions. I found that an inversion-symmetry-breaking gap function (e.g. p-wave) can induce such a peak in the attenuation constant, but we determined that their observation is more likely due to domain wall fluctuations between regions with different superconducting order parameters.'
