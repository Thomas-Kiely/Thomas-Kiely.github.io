excerpt: 'When modeling physical systems with global symmetries using matrix product states, one can encode the symmetry as a block-sparse constraint on the tensor products. This, in effect, constrains the accessible variational manifold to states that explicitly obey the imposed symmetry. Such techniques are indispensable when modeling finite-sized systems. In the thermodynamic limit, however, it is not obvious how such a constraint will interact with the tendency of systems to spontaneously break a symmetry. We study two examples of critical Luttinger liquids using infinite matrix product states with and without imposed symmetries. We determine that the relative performance of each variational state is a scaling function of the Luttinger parameter, and we quantify a variety of practical considerations.'
