title: "Bandwidth-tuned Wigner-Mott Transition at ν=1/5: an Infinite Matrix Product State Study"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-Preprint-TMD
excerpt: 'Using infinite matrix product states (iMPS), we study the quantum flucutation-induced (zero-temperature) phase transition between a Wigner-Mott (WM) insulator and a metallic Fermi liquid at electronic filling ν=1/5 (corresponding to a total filling of 2/5). This particular WM insulator has both a spin and a charge gap, making it particularly amenable to study using an iMPS ansatz. On a two-leg-ladder geometry, we find that there is an intermediate gapless phase between the WM insulator and the gapless Luttinger liquid -- a Luther-Emery liquid. This state is a one-dimensional analogue to a fluctuating superconductor: there is no gap to 2-particle Cooper pair excitations, but the single-electron excitation is gapped. This state often arises due to an attractive interaction. Here, we believe that this occurs due to residual pairing between spins in the WM insulating phase. On the five-leg cylinder, our simulations are consistent with the existence of a gapless intermediate phase but we cannot rule out the existence of a direct transition.'
