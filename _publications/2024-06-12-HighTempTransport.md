title: "High-temperature transport in the one-dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-06-12-HighTempTransport
excerpt: 'The limit of high temperature is generically a simple starting point for calculations, as the infinite-temperature state is well-understood. Dynamics at high temperatures, however, are not necessarily so simple. Motivated by the difficulty of achieving low temperatures in ultracold atom systems, here we study the high-temperature transport properties of a 1D Fermi-Hubbard model with a mass imbalance. We find that, by tuning the mass imbalance, the model interpolates between two distinct integrable limits: a perfect metal and an insulator. Neither of these are what one usually expects in a high-temperature system. Using infinite matrix product state techniques, we quantitatively determine signatures of these states and study how relaxation timescales evolve as the mass imbalance is varied.'
