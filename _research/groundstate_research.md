## Questions
- How does the number of spatial dimensions alter the zero temperature (quantum) phase diagram? How does it change the nature of phase transitions?
  - Can superfluid phenomenology be observed in one-dimensional Luttinger liquids? If so, how can we measure it?
- What sorts of insulating phases are stabilized by long-range interactions?
  - What is the nature of the Wigner-Mott metal-insulator transition in van der Waals heterostructures? Can similar physics be observed in Rydberg arrays?

## Background

We're all familiar with finite-temperature phase transitions: ice melting, water boiling, etc. In our everyday experience, these transitions are driven by changes in temperature, which simply the average kinetic energy of the system. When the temperature is very low, water molecules stick together and form a crystalline structure (ice). When the temperature is very high, the molecules spread out so that they can move around more easily. In this gaseous phase, those sticky interactions become less important. Interestingly, at an intermediate temperature scale the molecules form a liquid: they spread out enough to move around a bit, but interactions remain important.

In general, phase transitions depend on more than temperature. For example, the phase diagram of water depends also on the ambient pressure. In my work, I have thought about phase transitions that occur at _zero temperature_. In these systems, particles at zero temperature still have some finite kinetic energy due to quantum fluctuations. Hence, the phase transition depends on the ratio of those quantum fluctuations (which we refer to with an energy scale called the _bandwidth_) and the energy associated with interactions. Certain experimental systems, including cold atoms and van der Waals heterostructures, have demonstrated the ability to tune the ratio of bandwidth to interactions, hence allowing them to probe these transitions. While these experiments cannot reduce the temperature to zero, the effects of these zero-temperature critical points can still be seen at finite (albeit low) temperatures.

<!-- ## What is a superfluid?

Superfluidity is probably one of the most well-known macroscopic manifestations of quantum mechanics. As a phase of matter, it is generally defined in terms of two distinct phenomena: _irrotationality_ (otherwise known as the Hess-Fairbanks effect) and _metastable superflow_. These can be visualized with a simple (albeit handwaving) thought experiment. Consider a drinking glass filled with some superfluid substance.
  - Irrotationality: Now imagine slowly but continuously rotating the drinking glass. An ordinary fluid would eventually begin to rotate with the glass. The time it would take to begin rotating would depend on its viscosity. A superfulid, by contrast, can be considered to have _zero viscosity_, and consequently it would never rotate. Of course, one has to be somewhat careful about what "slow" rotation really means.
  - Metastable superflow: Now imagine we've rotated the glass quickly enough to get the superfluid rotating. This can be done with sufficiently violent rotation. The superfluid is moving with the glass, but now we _stop_ rotating the glass. The fact that the superfluid state supports metastable superflow means that the fluid will continue to rotate, in spite of the friction on the walls of the glass. As with the Hess-Faibanks effect, this rotating state will last for astronomically long timescales.

The distinction between these conditions is rather subtle. I attempted a more careful (and technical) explanation as a part of my [A Exam](\files\Erich_A_Exam.pdf), but perhaps one would be better off just reading Leggett's short [review article](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.71.S318) on the subject.

## Why one dimension?

This relates to the question of why superfluidity happens in the first place. The classic textbook picture of a superfluid is a three-dimensional Bose gas that's cooled to lower and lower temperatures. The bosonic nature of the particles is important: while fermions (e.g. electrons) obey the Pauli exclusion principle and cannot occupy the same quantum state, bosons have no such constraint. Below a certain temperature, one finds that a macroscopic number of bosons preferentially occupy the lowest-energy single-particle state of the system. This is known as _Bose-Einstein condensation_.

Superfluidity is often associated with Bose-Einstein condensation, which is when a system of bosonic particles becomes phase-coherent across macroscopic length scales. "Normal" superfluids will often see signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation occur at the same time as the onset of superfluid phenomenology. In one dimension, however, strong quantum fluctuations prevent macroscopic phase coherence from occuring. What, then, is the fate of one-dimensional superfluids?

## What did we do?

This question, as well as a multitude of answers, has existed in the literature for quite some time. The knee-jerk answer is that superfluidity cannot occur in one dimension, and there are quite a few reasons to think this. In our paper, however, we take a contrasting view.  -->
