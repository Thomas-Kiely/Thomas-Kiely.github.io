<!-- ## What is a superfluid?

Superfluidity is probably one of the most well-known macroscopic manifestations of quantum mechanics. As a phase of matter, it is generally defined in terms of two distinct phenomena: _irrotationality_ (otherwise known as the Hess-Fairbanks effect) and _metastable superflow_. These can be visualized with a simple (albeit handwaving) thought experiment. Consider a drinking glass filled with some superfluid substance.
  - Irrotationality: Now imagine slowly but continuously rotating the drinking glass. An ordinary fluid would eventually begin to rotate with the glass. The time it would take to begin rotating would depend on its viscosity. A superfulid, by contrast, can be considered to have _zero viscosity_, and consequently it would never rotate. Of course, one has to be somewhat careful about what "slow" rotation really means.
  - Metastable superflow: Now imagine we've rotated the glass quickly enough to get the superfluid rotating. This can be done with sufficiently violent rotation. The superfluid is moving with the glass, but now we _stop_ rotating the glass. The fact that the superfluid state supports metastable superflow means that the fluid will continue to rotate, in spite of the friction on the walls of the glass. As with the Hess-Faibanks effect, this rotating state will last for astronomically long timescales.

The distinction between these conditions is rather subtle. I attempted a more careful (and technical) explanation as a part of my [A Exam](\files\Erich_A_Exam.pdf), but perhaps one would be better off just reading Leggett's short [review article](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.71.S318) on the subject.

## Why one dimension?

This relates to the question of why superfluidity happens in the first place. The classic textbook picture of a superfluid is a three-dimensional Bose gas that's cooled to lower and lower temperatures. The bosonic nature of the particles is important: while fermions (e.g. electrons) obey the Pauli exclusion principle and cannot occupy the same quantum state, bosons have no such constraint. Below a certain temperature, one finds that a macroscopic number of bosons preferentially occupy the lowest-energy single-particle state of the system. This is known as _Bose-Einstein condensation_.

Superfluidity is often associated with Bose-Einstein condensation, which is when a system of bosonic particles becomes phase-coherent across macroscopic length scales. "Normal" superfluids will often see signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation occur at the same time as the onset of superfluid phenomenology. In one dimension, however, strong quantum fluctuations prevent macroscopic phase coherence from occuring. What, then, is the fate of one-dimensional superfluids?

## What did we do?

This question, as well as a multitude of answers, has existed in the literature for quite some time. The knee-jerk answer is that superfluidity cannot occur in one dimension, and there are quite a few reasons to think this. In our paper, however, we take a contrasting view.  -->
